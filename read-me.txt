Code Release Policy

The goal of DnC is twofold:

- 1. Protect the code specifically created by DnC and the OAuthSD server 
configuration to make it more difficult for criminals or malicious hacker. 
For this, the code in the directories /commons, /oauth and /oidc is not open 
source but subject to a particular license.

- 2. Disseminate as much information and source code as possible to allow anyone 
to integrate with the OAuthSD server authentication delegation and resource 
protection into their applications . For that all the rest of the code, not 
present in the directories mentioned above, is diffused under license GPLv3 or 
another license indicated in the code, in particular that coming from other 
developers.

This policy applies both to the code present on this server and to the code 
deployed among OAuthSD users.
