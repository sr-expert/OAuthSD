# OAuthSD
OpenID Connect OAuth Server by DnC.

OAuthSD is an authentication server that implements OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect plus some useful extensions.

OAuthSD offers you the best: to ensure not only Single Sign On (SSO), but also Single Sign-In (SLI) on multiple applications, silent re-authentication (Silent Re-Authentication, SRA) and Single Sign Out (SLO). 
See: <a href="https://oa.dnc.global/web/-OpenID-Connect-SSO-management-de-session-etc-.html#slisloetsrasontdansunbateauoauthsd">SLI, SLO and SRA are in a boat: OAuthSD</a>. 
While most implementations require developments on the side of client applications, OAUthSD offers you these features without any modification of them. 

OAuthSD also allow end user to monitor and manage the OpenID Connect session.

A web interface allows developers to <a href="https://oa.dnc.global/web/spip.php?page=gerer">manage client applications</a> and <a href="https://oa.dnc.global/web/spip.php?page=gerer">track the activity</a> of the OIDC server. 

This repository displays the code of <a href="htps://oa.dnc.global">oa.dnc.global</a> website that implements a demonstrator of OAuthSD. If you are interested in a production version of OAuthSD, on a private server of your property, contact DnC.
This demonstator is in continual development; the server may be unavailable and the data deleted at any time. Use at your own risk, DnC offers no guarantee.
