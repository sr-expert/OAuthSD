# OAuthSD
OpenID Connect OAuth Server by DnC.

OAuthSD is an authentication server that implements OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect plus some useful extensions.

OAuthSD offers you the best: to ensure not only Single Sign On (SSO), but also Single Sign-In (SLI) on multiple applications, silent re-authentication (Silent Re-Authentication, SRA) and Single Sign Out (SLO). 
See: <a href="https://oa.dnc.global/web/-OpenID-Connect-SSO-management-de-session-etc-.html#slisloetsrasontdansunbateauoauthsd">SLI, SLO and SRA are in a boat: OAuthSD</a>. 
While most implementations require developments on the side of client applications, OAUthSD offers you these features without any modification of them. 

OAuthSD also allows end user to monitor and manage the OpenID Connect session.

A web interface allows developers to <a href="https://oa.dnc.global/web/spip.php?page=gerer">manage client applications</a> and <a href="https://oa.dnc.global/web/spip.php?page=gerer">track the activity</a> of the OIDC server. 

It appears that the OIDC server is not the hardest to mount. The tricky point is the transformation of applications to delegate authentication with the OIDC protocol. Developers will find on this site <a href="https://oa.dnc.global/web/?rubrique19">examples of plugins or extensions</a> as well as code for the <a href="https://oa.dnc.global/web/?rubrique27">management of the OIDC session</a>.

This repository displays the code of <a href="https://oa.dnc.global">oa.dnc.global</a> website that implements a demonstrator of OAuthSD. 
This demonstator is in continual development; the server may be unavailable and the data deleted at any time. Use at your own risk, DnC offers no guarantee.

If you are interested in a production version of OAuthSD, on a private server of your property, or adapt your applications to OIDC, please <a href="https://oa.dnc.global/web/auteur1">contact DnC</a>.
