# OAuthSD
OpenID Connect OAuth Server by DnC.

OAuthSD is an authentication server that implements OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect and offers some useful extensions.

OAuthSD offers you the best: to ensure not only Single Sign On (SSO), but also Single Sign-In (SLI) on multiple applications, silent re-authentication (Silent Re-Authentication, SRA) and Single Sign Out (SLO). 
See: <a href="https://oa.dnc.global/web/-OpenID-Connect-SSO-management-de-session-etc-.html#slisloetsrasontdansunbateauoauthsd">SLI, SLO and SRA are in a boat: OAuthSD</a>. 
While most implementations require developments on the side of client applications, OAUthSD offers you these features without any modification of them. 

OAuthSD also allow client-side monitoring and management of the OpenID Connect session.
